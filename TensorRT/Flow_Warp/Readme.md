Args: two input
x (Tensor): Tensor with size (n, c, h, w).
flow (Tensor): Tensor with size (n, 2,h, w). The last dimension is
    a two-channel, denoting the width and height relative offsets.
    Note that the values are not normalized to [-1, 1].
interpolation (str): Interpolation mode: 'nearest' or 'bilinear'.
    Default: 'bilinear'.
padding_mode (str): Padding mode: 'zeros' or 'border' or 'reflection'.
    Default: 'zeros'.
align_corners (bool): Whether align corners. Default: True.
Returns:
Tensor: Warped image or feature map.
